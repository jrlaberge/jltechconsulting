## Services

I am still figuring out what my services are, and so I can't provide any exact rates just yet.

Please reach out to me with a description of your needs and I'll work out a quote for you.

Here are some samples of services I've provided for clients in the past.

* Hardware installation (Cable management, hardware setup and configuration etc.)
* Software installation (This can be done in bulk, I've worked with a large number of business/enterprise grade software such as Quickbooks, Microsoft Office, etc.)
* PC Builds (I've built hundreds of PCs, including gaming and business grade servers)
* Website creation
* Custom domains, email addresses, etc.
* Automation of manual computer tasks (For instance, I can make your PC workflow much more efficient or in many cases, happen automatically to drastically save you time. Some examples of this can be automating parts of a spreadsheet, automating data entry etc.)

This is a short list of some of my recent works, if you need help that relates to a computer or technical need, I'm sure I can help so send me a message and let's get started.
